== Business Use Case

You are a consultant assigned to a telecommunications company called MitziCom. MitziCom provides hosting and cloud services to a variety of clients, from medium-sized companies to enterprise giants.

MitziCom has asked you to lead a 30- to 40-hour proof-of-concept (POC) using Red Hat Ansible Tower. The purpose of the POC is to determine the feasibility of using Ansible Tower as a CI/CD tool for automating continuous deployment of an internal three-tier application on QA and production environments. Note that this requires maintaining several instances of the application.


== POC Requirements

MitziCom management requires that you include all of the items listed in these subsections in your POC.


=== Basic Requirements

* GitHub repository
* Playbooks to deploy internal three-tier application
* Install Ansible Tower Isolated Node


=== Provision QA Environment
* Develop Ansible Playbook to install Ansible Tower Isolated Node
* Develop Ansible Playbooks to provision instances on OpenStack to support the three-tier application
* Playbooks need to be accessible through a GitHub repository
* Set up Ansible Tower to use Tower Isolated node to reach instances running on OpenStack
* Develop a task to run a smoke test on the QA environment for the three-tier application from Ansible Tower
* Develop a playbook to destroy the QA environment on OpenStack if the smoke test fails


== Setup and Playbooks Provided as support

* Ansible Tower will be installed for you.
* Playbooks for provisioning OSP network components will be provided.


.Suggested Playbooks
* `Provision_OSP.yml`
* `Configure_3TA_OSP.yml` (include smoke test task)
* `cleanup_OSP.yml` (runs if other tasks fail, destroys OpenStack instances)

=== Provision Production Environment

* Develop Ansible Playbooks to provision infrastructure on AWS instances using `Order_SVC.sh` script (see below)
* Playbooks need to be accessible through a GitHub repository
* Develop playbooks to run a smoke test on the production environment for the three-tier application using a public URL

.Suggested Playbooks
* `Provision_AWS.yml`
* `Configure_3TA_AWS.yml` (include smoke test task)
* `cleanup_AWS.yml` (runs if other tasks fail, destroys OpenStack instances)

=== Design Ansible Tower Workflow Job Template

* Define a workflow to automate the process of provisioning the QA and production environments
** Workflow needs to include the deployment and testing of the three-tier application

.Outline
. Deploy instances on OpenStack QA environment
. Configure instances on OpenStack QA environment (smoke test)
.. Clean up if failed
. Deploy instances on AWS using `Order_SVC.sh` script
. Configure instances on AWS production environment (smoke test)
.. Clean up if failed

=== Lab Environment

The lab details a recommended process for meeting MitziCom's requirements, as defined in the lab's goals. Information about the infrastructure, DNS names, passwords, and more is provided throughout the lab.

NOTE: Use the same environments as you did in class.

==== Provisioned Environment Hosts

The lab environment consists of two life-cycle environments.

.QA Environment

The development environment, running Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10, is hidden behind the firewall. You need to provision instances on OpenStack for developers to test their three-tier application.

* Ansible Tower Isolated Node: `workstation-${GUID}.rhpds.opentlc.com` (This GUID is different than
the GUID used for your Ansible Tower environment.)
* OpenStack controller host: `ctrl.example.com`

.Production Environment

* Administration server: `bastion.{GUID}.example.opentlc.com`, `bastion.${GUID}.internal`
* HAProxy server: `frontend1.{GUID}.example.opentlc.com`, `frontend1.${GUID}.internal`
* Tomcat servers: `app{1,2}.${GUID}.internal`
* Database server: `appdb1.${GUID}.internal`


.Management Servers

* Administration server: `bastion.{GUID}.example.opentlc.com`, `bastion.${GUID}.internal`
* Ansible Tower nodes: `tower{1,2,3}.${GUID}.example.opentlc.com`, `tower{1,2,3}.${GUID}.internal`
* Ansible Tower database servers: `support{1,2}.${GUID}.internal`


== Provision QA Environment

In this section, you will use the playbooks and roles to setup the QA environment. 

. Roles to provision OpenStack Platform-hosted infrastructure using the network details provided below:
. Clone the GitHub repo to get the roles and playbooks for setting up network components, flavors and images in OSP Env. 
[source,text]
----
# git clone https://github.com/prakhar1985/homework-assignment-automation
----

. Use Playbook `setup-osp-infra.yml` which will setup the below given components.
. Playbook will do the follwoing:
.. Create Public and Private network
.. Create Flavor for OSP Instances
.. Create Glance Image for OSP Instances
.. Create SSH Keypair with the name `ansible_ssh`.
.. Create security groups that allows traffic on the ports required to access the application from the isoloated node.


.Public Network
[options="header",caption=""]
|======================================
|Purpose    |Subnet
|CIDR       |10.10.10.0/24
|Routes     |0.0.0.0/0, 192.168.0.0/24
|Nameservers|8.8.8.7, 8.8.8.8
|======================================


.Private Network
[options="header",caption=""]
|=========================
|Purpose|Subnet
|CIDR   |20.20.20.0/24
|=========================

[NOTE]
The private network is a non-routable network.


.Custom flavor per the developer requirements for defining the hardware profile of instances:

[cols="2"]
|========================
|Name    | m2.small
|RAM     | 2048
|VCPUS   | 1
|Disk    | 5 (Do not get this wrong)
|========================



== Provision OSP Instances



. Create a role to create instances.

. Implement requirements defined by the developers to test the application.

* Per the organization's security policy, you inject two separate public keys
** Use `openstack.pub` and `openstack.pem` keys to connect to the jumpbox (workstation) and OpenStack Platform-hosted instances

* Add public keys for managing instances from Ansible Tower
** link:http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/openstack_keys/openstack.pub["http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/openstack_keys/openstack.pub^"]
** link:http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/openstack_keys/openstack.pem["http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/openstack_keys/openstack.pem^"]

* Configure your instance to use the organization's local yum repository
** link:http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/repo/internal.repo["http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/repo/internal.repo^"]

. Push all of the roles to GitHub to use them in the Ansible workflow job template.
+
WARNING: Do not push the .pem file or the repository host name into your Git repository.

=== Deploy Three-Tier Application on QA Environment

In this section you test the previously created roles and playbooks to deploy the three-tier application on the QA environment from Ansible Tower.

. Test your roles and playbooks present on GitHub to deploy the three-tier application on instances launched on OpenStack.

. Use `curl` or `wget` to test your deployed application from the jumpbox.


== Provision Production Environment

In this section, you write a playbook that uses the script to provision the production
environment on AWS.

* Prerequisite for the script that provisions the production environment:
+
[source,text]
----
mkdir ~/bin
wget http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/scripts/common.sh
wget http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/scripts/jq-linux64 -O ~/bin/jq
wget http://www.opentlc.com/download/ansible_bootcamp/scripts/order_svc.sh
chmod +x order_svc.sh ~/bin/jq
----

* Steps to run the shell script to deploy the production environment from the bastion host:
+
[source,text]
----
cat << EOF > credential.rc
export username=<userid-companyname.com>
export password=<cf password>
export uri=https://labs.opentlc.com
EOF

source credential.rc ; ./order_svc.sh -c 'OPENTLC Automation' -i 'Three Tier Application' -t 1

----
+
[NOTE]
Non-Interactive: Use `-y` if you do not want to be prompted and you are sure you want to
continue.
+
WARNING: Using this script always deploys environments in the `us-east-1` region.

=== Deploy Three-Tier Application on Production Environment

In this section, you deploy the three-tier application on the production environment.

. Use `ec2.py` or `ec2_facts` (or similar) to create the dynamic inventory.
* If you are using Ansible Tower inventory, use the `Instance Filter` with the following
tag: `tag:instance_filter=three-tier-app-psrivast*` where `psrivast` is the first part of
your company email id, as in `psrivast@redhat.com`.

. Use dynamic inventory or in-memory inventory to fetch the EC2 instances' facts.

. Use tested roles and playbooks to deploy the three-tier application on the production
environment from Ansible Tower.

. Test your application by browsing the public URL of the `frontend` server from your
laptop.
+
[NOTE]
AWS read-only user credentials are created for you. Please provide your GUID
to the instructor, so they can inject these credentials directly into your
Ansible Tower environment to enable retrieving dynamic inventories from AWS.
+
[TIP]
All EC2 tags become groups in dynamic inventory. Use `ec2.ini` to limit the scope of
Ansible Tower's reach.


== Design Ansible Tower Workflow Job Templates

In this section, you design a workflow job template in Ansible Tower.

The diagram below shows the workflow for developing a CI/CD pipeline in Ansible
Tower.

. Use the roles and playbooks you have pushed to GitHub to create the workflow job template.
. Promote deployments from the QA environment to the production environment.
